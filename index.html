          <em>Best seen on four wheels</em>, Canada is blessed with enormous
          landscapes, wide, wild expanses and roads that wind straight through
          the middle of it all. To explore lakes, waterfalls, national parks and
          the jaw-dropping contours of the Rockies in Western Canada, rent a car
          or take an RV on the road, then eat, sleep and immerse yourself in
          spectacular scenery. Set off from Pacific-facing Vancouver and head
          inland towards Calgary. Each windscreen vista will be more spectacular
          than the last, <strong>just watch out for grizzlies!</strong> 🐻
